# Global Terrorism Analysis and Security Insights

This project aims to perform an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a dataset related to global terrorism incidents. The goal is to identify terrorism hot zones and derive security insights that can aid in formulating counter-terrorism strategies.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this analysis is the Global Terrorism Database (GTD). It includes information on terrorist events around the world from 1970 through 2017. Each record includes information about the event, such as the date, location, type of attack, weapon used, and casualties.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/global-terrorism-analysis-eda.git
    cd global-terrorism-analysis-eda
    ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
    ```sh
    python -m venv env
    source env/bin/activate  # On Windows use `env\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

Run the Jupyter notebook to perform the analysis:
```sh
jupyter notebook Global_Terrorism_Analysis.ipynb
